#Tech Books Library

## Introduction
The web application allows users to share and review their technical reading material. Technical books like other genres, if not more so, benefit the reader from having some credibility due either from word of mouth or reviews. 


We are trying to create a community of technical readers who are able to share feedback, reviews, errata and many useful data points that allow finding the appropriate technical book for the reader.
